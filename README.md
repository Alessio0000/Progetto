<h1>Hello I'm Alessio Zedda and this is my personal Website.</h1>
<h2>It is a project for Start2Impact</h2>
<p>This project serves as a showcase of my HTML and CSS skills. I've crafted a single-page website with smooth navigation facilitated by anchor links, allowing seamless transitions between sections.
  External links are limited to my social profiles and the CV page, ensuring a focused user experience.
To elevate accessibility, I've thoughtfully created bilingual pages in both Italian and English, enabling a wider audience to explore my work.
I had to include some JavaScript to enhance functionality, primarily focusing on form validation to facilitate communication.
Furthermore, I also included Bootstrap to experiment with the design and external libraries like Prism.js to elevate the presentation of Solidity code with syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>For color scheme, simplicity was key. I opted for two dominant colors: vibrant green and  blue. Against a dark blue background, they create a striking contrast.
  To add a touch of dynamism, I incorporated a few animations upon page loading, getting movement into the experience.
Given the constraints of using only HTML and CSS, I opted for a minimalist approach to design. 
Ensuring accessibility across devices was a priority. With a single breakpoint at 550px in the main page, and 2 in the CV page, the design seamlessly adapts to smaller screens, maintaining clarity and usability.</p>
<p>While I couldn't fully express myself as desired, I encourage you to explore the project firsthand. Its straightforward layout and design make for an intuitive user experience.</p>
